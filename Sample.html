		<p>Hello, I am Jero Benedict P. Berdida. 
		The years have caught up to me and I am now 15 years of age. 
		Currently, I am pursuing education in DBTC - Cebu as a junior highschool student.
		Throughout the pandemic, I have come to appreciate the bygone days.
		The days where we could run, jump, and shout in the school.
		I have learned a lot through the sacrifice of freedom in return for health and safety.
		Inspite of this, I still look forward to the start of limited face to face classes in the next school year.
		I have been spending atleast 2 school years	now at long distance learning. 
		I feel like I missed out on a lot oppurtunities.
		Oppurtunities that the school offer and memories from school interactions.
		In my opinion, that is the true selling point of schools.</p>

		&nbsp
		<p>I had not much of an ambition growing up.
		I would always space out in the present.
		I would also be more of a passive person.
		But now, I have come to realize that the present is a precious time.
		I have to make use of it before it becomes the past.
